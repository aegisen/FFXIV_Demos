                "Have you heard of the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV? With an expanded free trial which you can play through the entirety
                of A Realm Reborn and the award-winning Heavensward expansion up to level 60 for free with no restrictions on playtime." - Popular Copypasta

            Final Fantasy 14, known commonly as <dfn>FFXIV</dfn>, is a subscription-based Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game <dfn>(MMORPG)</dfn> based on the lore and style of the Final Fantasy series.
            In the game, players can play as a variety of <dfn>Jobs</dfn> from different <dfn>Roles</dfn> (Tank, DPS, Healer), each with its unique playstyle and skillset.
            The game boasts an extensive story, and each patch updates the game with new <dfn>Main Story Quests</dfn> (MSQ). Through the MSQs, the game feels reminiscent of a traditional
            JRPG game. In addition to MSQs, there are other means to enjoy the game. Interacting with fellow players throughout the expansive world, defeating open-world bosses, and the Casino are
            some ways players spend their time. Arguably one of the most popular game contents is the game's endgame content: <dfn>Savage and Ultimate raids</dfn>. These contents require
            high skill and coordinated teamwork, involving intricate puzzle-like mechanics in difficult boss battles. Both Savage and Ultimate raids are challenged with 8-man parties.
            Savage raids are considered difficult endgame content, and Ultimate raids are considered the most difficult, challenging battles available in the game.
